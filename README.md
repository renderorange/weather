get cha some weather from wunderground

## description
weather.pl is a script to get current conditions and 4 day forecast from wunderground's API.

## setup
to run weather.pl, you'll need to first get a wunderground API key, from here: [https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api][wunderground]

then, to use the key, weather.pl expects a file named .weather.rc present in the same directory it resides.

like this...
```
~/scripts/weather $ ls -1a
weather.pl
.weather.rc
```

inside the .weather.rc file, weather.pl expects a key value pair, separated by colon, containing your wunderground api key.

like so...
```
$ cat .weather.rc 
# weather.pl settings
api_key:1a2s3d4f5g6h7j8k
```
warning, not a real key ^

weather.pl is a little forgiving with formatting of the rc file, but will let you know if something isn't right.

## usage
```
$ perl weather.pl -h
usage: ./weather.pl -z 77429 -f

options:
	--zip		specify where you want weather results for
				without --zip, weather.pl performs a geolookup to find where you are

	--forecast	additionally displays the next 4 day forecast

	--help		displays this dialogue
```

weather.pl only has two options other than the help dialogue.

run without any options, weather.pl will do a geolookup to [http://ip-api.com/json][ipapi] to match your outbound IP to related zip code.

if you're running through a proxy, the geolocation API call won't be accurate.
```

Yeah, it's kind of hipster.  Fight the power, and all that.

I'll probably change it again something soon, but it's late and I need to go home and go to sleep.
